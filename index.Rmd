# Regression Diagnostics

<br>

#### When conducting **regression diagnostics**, a common practice is to plot the **residual plot**.

#### Unfortunately, **visual discoveries** can sometimes be misleading or inaccurate.

- It looks like an indication of heteroskedasticity, but the model is correctly specified.

# Visual Inference


#### Visual inference (Buja, et al. 2009) is a **statistical inferential framework**.


#### A **lineup** consists of 
- #### one **data plot**, and
- #### $m âˆ’ 1$ plots (**null plots**) containing data **consistent with the null hypothesis**.

#### To perform a **visual test**, observer(s) will be asked to select the **most different plot(s)** from the lineup. And we check if the data plot is identified.

```{r}
set.seed(10131)
mod$gen_lineup(300, k = 20, pos = 8) %>%
  filter(null != FALSE) %>%
  bind_rows(ori_dat %>% mutate(k = 8, null = FALSE)) %>%
  VI_MODEL$plot_lineup(theme = theme_light(base_size = 12),
                       remove_grid_line = TRUE,

# Motivation

### However, the lineup protocol is **unsuitable for large-scale applications**
- #### High labor costs
- #### Time-consuming
- #### Usability issues for individuals with visual impairments

# Research questions
]

### Build an automatic visual inference system to read residual plots

#### 1. Exploring the application of visual inference in regression diagnostics and comparing it with conventional hypothesis tests.

#### 2. Designing an automated visual inference system to assess lineups of residual plots of classical normal linear regression model.

#### 3. Deploying the automatic visual inference system as an online application and publishing the relevant open-source software.

# A Plot is Worth a Thousand Tests: Assessing Residual Diagnostics with the Lineup Protocol
#### Weihao Li, Dianne Cook, Emi Tanaka and Susan VanderPlas (2023)
(Manuscript submitted to JCGS under review)

---

#### We set up a **visual inference experiment** with 443 participants to compare **visual tests** and **conventional tests** in the context of regression diagnostics.

### Non-linearity Patterns

### Heteroskedasticity Patterns

.image-center[

```{r out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/heterpower-1.png")
```

### We found that


#### 1. Conventional residual-based statistical tests are **more sensitive to weak departures** from model assumptions than visual tests as would be evaluated by humans. 

--

#### 2. Conventional tests often reject when departures in the form of non-linearity and heteroskedasticity **are not visibly different** from null residual plots.

--

#### 3. Residual plots need to be **delivered as a lineup** to enables a **careful calibration**.

--

#### 4. Power of the conventional test are **quite sensitive** to **how the predictors are sampled**.

--

#### 5. The **direction of heteroskedasticity** appears to affect the ability to visually detect it.
